# Mental-Health

This project uses linear models in R to analyze and predict trends in county-level suicide rates. The project began with data wrangling in R to produce a clean and highly usable data set. I employed the following statistical methods to produce a predictive model:

* Utilized AIC (Akaike information criterion) in a criterion model selection algorithm.
* Analyzed quality of fit with QQ plots and plots of residual vs. fitted values.
* Applied transformative methods to address non-normality in variables.
* Took an iterative approach to modeling.
